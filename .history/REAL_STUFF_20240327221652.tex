% First column
\begin{column}{.30\linewidth}
\begin{block}{Introduction}
Mathematics is the language with which the universe can be described with great precision. This poster highlights some of the most fundamental theorems that have shaped our understanding of mathematics today.
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Fundamental Theorem of Calculus}
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus links the concept of the derivative of a function with the concept of the integral.
\[
\frac{d}{dx} \int_a^x f(t)\, dt = f(x)
\]
\end{block}
\end{column}

% Second column
\begin{column}{.30\linewidth}
\begin{block}{Pythagorean Theorem}
In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
\[
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\]
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Euler's Identity}
Euler's Identity is a special case of Euler's formula from complex analysis and is sometimes cited as an example of mathematical beauty.
\[
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
\]
\end{block}
\end{column}

% Third column
\begin{column}{.30\linewidth}
\begin{block}{Conclusion}
The beauty of mathematics is evident in its theorems, providing profound insights into the natural world and the underlying structure of the universe.
